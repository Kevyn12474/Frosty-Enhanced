## 📖 Overview

**Frosty** is an advanced Magisk/KernelSU/APatch module that optimizes your Android device by selectively freezing unnecessary Google Mobile Services (GMS) components and enabling deep battery optimization.

Unlike other optimizers, Frosty gives you **granular control** over which service categories to disable, allowing you to balance battery savings with functionality.

**Based on the work of [GhostGMS](https://github.com/kaushikieeee/GhostGMS)**

### Why Frosty?

- 🔋 **Massive Battery Savings** - Disable power-hungry GMS services that run 24/7
- 💤 **Doze Integration** - Force Android to optimize all apps including GMS to improve battery
- 🎯 **Selective Control** - Choose exactly which features to keep or freeze
- ⚡ **Kernel Optimizations** - Optional scheduler, VM, and network tweaks
- 🔄 **Fully Reversible** - Toggle between Frozen and Stock modes instantly
- 📊 **Detailed Logging** - Know exactly what's happening on your device


## ✨ Features

### 🧊 GMS Service Freezing
Disable Google services organized into 8 logical categories:
- **Telemetry** - Ads, analytics, tracking (safe to disable)
- **Background** - Updates, background sync (safe to disable)
- **Location** - GPS, geofencing, activity recognition
- **Connectivity** - Chromecast, Quick Share, Nearby
- **Cloud** - Backup, sync, authentication
- **Payments** - Google Pay, Wallet, NFC
- **Wearables** - Wear OS, Google Fit
- **Games** - Play Games achievements, cloud saves

### 💤 GMS Doze
Based on [Universal GMS Doze](https://github.com/gloeyisk/universal-gms-doze) by gloeyisk:
- **XML Patching** - Removes GMS from power-save whitelists
- **DeviceIdle Integration** - Allows Android Doze to optimize GMS
- **Conflict Resolution** - Patches other modules that whitelist GMS
- **Toggleable** - Enable/disable with the action button

### 🔋 Deep Doze
Based on [DeepDoze enforcer](https://github.com/Azyrn/DeepDoze-Enforcer) by Azyrn:
- **Deep Sleep Enforcement** - Forces the device into deep sleep immediately when the screen locks.
- **Background Restrictions** - Blocks apps from running in the background to stop battery-draining loops.
- **WAKE_LOCK Denial** - Denies WAKE_LOCK permissions to block useless CPU-heavy wakelocks.

### ⚡ System Optimizations
- **Kernel Tweaks** - Scheduler, VM, and network optimizations
- **Blur Disable** - Reduce GPU load by disabling UI blur effects
- **Log Killing** - Stop battery-draining log processes (logcat, traced, etc.)
- **Empty RC Files** - Overlay system init scripts to prevent debug daemons

### 📱 User Experience
- **Volume Key Selection** - Easy installation choices
- **Action Button Toggle** - Switch modes from root manager
- **Comprehensive Logs** - Detailed logs in `/data/adb/modules/FrostyEnhanced/logs/`
- **Status Report** - Quick status check via terminal
- **Clean Uninstall** - Complete reversal of all changes


## 📥 Installation

### Requirements
- Android 9.0+ (API 28+)
- Magisk 20.4+ / KernelSU / APatch
- Google Play Services installed

### Steps

1. **Download** the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/Drsexo/Frosty/releases)

2. **Install** via your root manager:
   - Magisk: Modules → Install from storage
   - KernelSU: Module → Install
   - APatch: Module → Install

3. **Configure** during installation:
   - Use **Volume Up** = YES / FREEZE
   - Use **Volume Down** = NO / SKIP   

4. **Reboot** to apply changes

**GMS Categories:**

#### Safe to Disable
| Category | Potential impact |
|----------|--------|
| 📊 **Telemetry** | No functional impact. Stops background data collection, ad tracking, and analytics reporting. Improves privacy without affecting user-facing features. May reduce ad personalization across Google services. |
| 🔄 **Background** | Minimal impact. Automatic app updates may be delayed until manual Play Store visits. Some background sync operations might take longer. Does not affect app functionality or notifications. |

#### May Break Features
| Category | Potential Impact |
|----------|--------|
| 📍 **Location** | Breaks all location-dependent functionality. Navigation apps fail to determine position or calculate routes. Location sharing stops working. Fitness tracking and step counting become unavailable. Weather apps may not detect local conditions. Ride-sharing and delivery apps lose pickup/dropoff accuracy. Smart home geofencing routines break. Emergency location services may be affected. |
| 📡 **Connectivity** | Breaks wireless device-to-device communication. Screen casting to TVs, speakers, and smart displays stops. Fast file sharing between nearby Android devices fails. Automatic Bluetooth accessory pairing breaks. Apps with cast functionality lose output options. Some smart home device setup flows may fail. |
| ☁️ **Cloud** | Breaks Google account integration across apps. "Sign in with Google" buttons fail. App data backup and restore stops. Password autofill and smart lock features break. Some banking and streaming apps may refuse to run due to security checks failing. Parental control features become unavailable. Instant app streaming stops working. |

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: My notifications are delayed after enabling GMS Doze
**A:** This is expected. GMS Doze allows Android to optimize GMS battery usage, which may slightly delay push notifications. If this is a problem: **disable GMS Doze during installation**.

### Q: Google Maps doesn't work
**A:** You froze the Location category. Use the action button to switch to Stock mode, or reinstall and skip the Location category.

### Q: Can I change settings after installation?
**A:** Yes! Simply reinstall the module and make different choices. Or use the action button to toggle between Frozen and Stock modes.

### Q: How do I know it's working?
**A:** Check the log files.

### Q: What's the difference between Frozen and Stock mode?
| Mode | Services | Doze | Kernel Tweaks |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| 🧊 Frozen | Disabled per config | Active | Applied |
| 🔥 Stock | All enabled | Inactive | Reverted after reboot |
